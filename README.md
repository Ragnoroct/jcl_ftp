# jcl_ftp
Auto submits Assembly 370 JCL files to Marist's zos server.

# Use
This simple script uses unix's ftp program to submit files to marist's server, saves the job id, and retrieves the output saving to your prefered directories.

#About Me
My name is Will Bender, but most people call me Willy. I'm extremely lazy so most of my time is spent programming trying to make my life easier. I hope that you find this script helpful and maybe never have to us TN3270 ever again with its awful ISfP editor.. ugh.
